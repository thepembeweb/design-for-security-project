Vulnerabilities:

Web service instance EC2
- TCP port 20 is reachable from the internet. Inspector agent can be installed on this instance to check for any process listening on this port.
- UDP port 21 is reachable from the internet. Inspector agent can be installed on this instance to check for any process listening on this port. 
- UDP port 23 is reachable from the internet. Inspector agent can be installed on this instance to check for any process listening on this port. 

S3 Buckets (cand-c3-free-recipes, cand-c3-private-recipes)
- s3-default-encryption-kms -> Amazon S3 bucket is not encrypted with AWS KMS key.
- s3-bucket-replication-enabled -> Amazon S3 buckets haven't have cross-region replication enabled.
- s3-bucket-logging-enabled -> Logging is not enabled for the S3 buckets.
- s3-bucket-versioning-enabled -> Versioning is not enabled for the S3 buckets. 
- s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled -> Amazon S3 bucket either doesn't have S3 default encryption enabled or 
  the S3 bucket policy doesn't explicitly denies put-object requests without server side encryption.
- s3-bucket-default-lock-enabled -> S3 Bucket lock is not enabled.
- s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only -> S3 buckets doesn't have policies that require requests to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

Remediation recommendations:
1) For AttackInstanceSG, ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22

2) For WebAppSG, ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 and 3389

3) S3 Block Public Access & Use VPC Endpoints to block requests that do not originate from your VPC network.

4) Security groups used as a second layer to restrict traffic to and from your cloud hosts and instances

5) Apply ACLs for incoming traffic to all subnets based on trusted networks.

6) Use of firewalls to provide the ability to granularly restrict and control network traffic to and from cloud VPCs, subnets and instances

7) Use regularly tools like Cfripper for the CloudFormation scripts
