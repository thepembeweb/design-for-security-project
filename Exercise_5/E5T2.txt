1) Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

    a. Scan infrastructure as code templates
    - Cfripper - https://github.com/Skyscanner/cfripper
    - CloudFormation Template Scanner - https://www.cloudconformity.com/solutions/aws/cloudformation-template-scanner.html
    - Cloudsploit - https://cloudsploit.com/cloudformation

    Example vulnerability
    - Wrong assignment to AWS Role on a resource
    - EC2SecurityGroupMissingEgressRule: Missing egress rule in NoIngressSecurityGroup means all traffic is allowed outbound. Make this explicit if it is desired configuration
    - Change in the encryption of a database
    
    b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
    - Anchore - https://anchore.com
    - Trivy - https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy
    - Clair - https://github.com/quay/clair
    
    Example vulnerability
    - Permissive system configurations for outside connections
    - OS outdated version vulnerabilities
    - Libraries outdated vulnerabilities

    c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
    - AWS inspector
    - AWS Config
    - AWS Security Hub
    - Cloudwatch alarms
    - Cloudtrail
    - AWS Guard Duty

    Example vulnerability
    - Accounts without MFA policies
    - Instances configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key.
    - Credentials without rotation policies
    - Very permissive IAM Policies or Roles
