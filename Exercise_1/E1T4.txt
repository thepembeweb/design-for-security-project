Poor practice 1
The first poor practice displayed here is that the s3 buckets do not follow the principle of least privilege.
S3 buckets are private by default and can be accessed only by users that are explicitly granted access. 
However, applying the principle of least privilege, it's a best practice to restrict access to your resources to the people that absolutely need it. 
You can restrict access to your S3 buckets or objects by:
1. Writing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user policies
2. Writing bucket policies that define access to specific buckets and objects. 
3. Using Amazon S3 Block Public Access as a centralized way to limit public access. 
4. Setting access control lists (ACLs) on your buckets and objects.


Poor practice 2
The second poor practice displayed here is that both public and private subnet network ACL rules allow all traffic on all ports from all ports.
Network ACL rules should be used to minimise the available network connectivity to reduce the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet. 
This reduces the chance of malicious actions that could be performed against the infrastructure by an attacker, and keeps the private subnet (and its contents) private.
